# Storytelling

- Good data scientist is also one part journalist
- Emotional understanding and decisions often occur before logic catches up
- Will be sharing:
    - Good News
    - Bad News
    - Boring News
    - Exciting News
- Always fighting perception and bias when telling story
    - Fundamental principles often applicable
    - How human psychology interacts with data
- Tableau
    - Common visualization platform
- Subreddit `data is beautiful` lots of trash
- **GOAL** Become above-average presenters

- CANVA link for exploratory code map. 
    - 100 links to websites, materials
    - More information than we have time in class for
    - Will discuss how to navigate link and curriculum

### 5 Best Practices for telling great stories with data

- Start by building a story
- Everyone who has data to analyze has a story to tell
- Interesting and memorable
- Keep it simple for busy executives
- Factual, detail-oriented, and data-driven
- You will need the “what” of your story (the facts and data) 
    - but you also need the “who?”, the “how?”, the “why?” and the often missed “so what?”.

### WHy Story?

- Make sense and order
- See the whole where there disparate parts
- Give vision to what the future can look like
- Interactive—people put themselves into stories
- Make your job easier

- Stories bring life to data and facts. 
- They can help you make sense and order out of a disparate collection of facts. 
- They make it easier to remember key points and can paint a vivid picture of what the future can look like.
- Stories also create interactivity—people put themselves
into stories and can relate to the situation.

### So What Is a Good Story?
- A good story or movie involves characters
- Challenge is believable
- There are hurdles to overcome
- Outcome or prognosis is clear

### Presenting Data Does Not Always Equate with a Good Story

- Behind the story is a detailed, highly quantitative study. 
- The story is simple but the analytical findings are not.
- Able to present these highly analytical findings in an
interesting and compelling way. 
- Yet, frequently the opposite happens. 
- A presentation filled with important data becomes boring, forgettable, and unclear.
- This happens easily because presentations are
structured before the story (with its dramatic findings) is
discovered. 
- In other words, the focus is on the presentation’s form above the content. 
- We show a chart of sales by region, then a chart of sales by product line, etc., missing the big picture


## Think of your analysis as a story - use a story structure
- Find the story first: explore the data
- Determine what you want people to do as a result
- Write out the “story board” for your audience

- When crafting a data-rich story, the first objective is to
find the story. 
   - Who are the characters? 
   - What is the drama or challenge? 
   - What hurdles have to be overcome? 
   - And at the end of your story, what do you want your audience to do as a result?

- Answering these questions obviously starts with analyzing the data and uncovering your findings.
- Think about the key questions you are trying to answer. 
- The more thoroughly you can explore your data, the more likely you’ll find the dramatic insights that make for a great story
- Once you know the core story, craft your other story
elements
   - define your characters
   - understand the challenge
   - identify the hurdles
   - crystallize the outcome or decision question. 
   - Make sure you are clear with what you want people to do as a result.

- With the story elements in place, write out the storyboard which represents the structure and form of your story. 
- Although it’s tempting to skip to this step, it is better first to understand the story you are telling and then to focus on the presentation structure and form.

- Once the storyboard is in place, the other elements will fall into place. 
- The storyboard will help you to think about the best analogies or metaphors, to clearly set up challenge/opportunity, and to finally see the flow and transitions needed.

- Keep your slides to a minimum, and if more detail or background is needed, you can make an appendix available for reference.

## BE authentic, your story will flow
- Make it personal, make it emotional
- Start with metaphor or anecdote
- Develop with data: authenticity is rooted in facts and
facts are rooted in data
- Supplement hard data with qualitative data

- Your audience wants to connect with you, they want you to be memorable and real.
- To best capture your audience’s attention, consider how you can take a data fact and make it personal, relatable and—if you’re lucky—emotional. 
- Is there a metaphor or anecdote to make the data more memorable and specific? 
- Does your audience like competitive sports? Then try use a sailing analogy.
- Take your story and develop it with data. 
    - Authenticity is rooted in facts. 
    - Facts are rooted in data. 
    - Since you’ve already reached them personally and captured their attention with a metaphor, now is the time to selectively present core facts and data that prove your point.

## 3. Be Visual: Think of yourself as a film editor
- Use pictures, graphs, charts when possible
- Design your graphs and charts for instant readability but allow for layers of meaning as the graph is studied

- Symbols and pictures are effective communication devices. 
- In one look, the viewer instantly assesses the message and can focus on the meaning.
- On the other hand, tables of data or numbers require people to look at each number, compare and contrast it to other numbers and then draw conclusions about the message. 
    - It is more work for the viewer when you use text. 
- A wellchosen and well-crated visual easily tells the story in a
single glance.

- The presentation of statistics and data are often essential to a good story. 
- The key is to create well-formed visual analysis, charts and  graphs.

- What is a well-formed visual analysis? Let’s start with
what it is not. 
   - It is not a table of data or an overly complex chart with multiple bullet points. 
- Sometimes, you need to look at your data in multiple ways before determining the most effective presentation

## 4. Make it easy for your audience and yuu

- Telling a story should be simple and direct. Recall and action will be that much stronger
- Stick to 2-3 key issues and how they relate to your audience
- No hoop jumping

- Story-telling makes the process of communication easier.
- Your audience will recall the key message and can act on
it. 
- This means that you haven’t buried them in too many issues and stories.
-  Multiple stories within one overall presentation or document are fine but realize that the human brain typically cannot hold more than three to five major facts or concepts.

## 5. Invite and direct discussion

- Focus on highlighting what the audience needs
- Highlight key facts that relate to the story—the current state, rate of change, a key number. How does this link to story’s trend?
-  Extend the story parameters into questions
- Invite them to continue the discussion via group discussion, blogs, intranets, newsgroups

## Summary
1. Think of Your Analysis as a Story—Use a Story
Structure
2. Be Authentic… Your Story will Flow
3. Be Visual—Think of Yourself as a Film Editor
4. Make it Easy for Your Audience and You
5. Invite and Direct Discussion
